Hello, fellow human (?) 👋 I am computer wizzard, who keeps learning new digital spells. 🧙‍♂️ Envision me as an IT & Design hybrid, which conveniently enough, is also my bachelor's title. My interest in computers started through entertainment. However, my specialization in Human-Computer Interaction made space in my chest for new design tools, such as coding and hardware. 💻 This love runs deep ever since.

Currently, I'm part of EIT's - Human Computer Interaction and Design Master program. 🎓 Here, I decided to specialise in Physical Interaction Design & Realisation at the KTH (Stockholm) in August, all thanks to the sponsorship of my generous benefactor, the European Union. 🇪🇺 As entry university I am happily attending the University of Twente, which has alumnis like Cees Links (WiFi innovator), Jaap Haartsen (inventor of Bluetooth), and Dirk-Willem van Gulik (a co-founder of the Apache Software Foundation)! Here, I'm forgeing my future ventures with studies about business, technological entrepreneurship and design. I strive to lift potent ideas into tangible products and refine them with and for people. 💼 

Another great thing the UT allows me to study is tinkering. To be precise the course Mastering Tinkering is what brought you this little portfolio website. Please be welcome to delve into my creations from this unusual course. 

## Even More About Me

As technical entrepreneur, my passion lies in easing human tech use. Studying Interaction Technology at UTwente has given me a lens to identify design needs beyond computers. Ever struggled to clean a glass that’s just too narrow? Feelings like this, prompt me to develop my own Design Language. 🎨 Who knows? Maybe we'll meet at a design agency bearing my name one day? All glasses there will be spotless, I promise. Until then, I'll continue drawing inspiration from giants like Apple, Braun or Teenage Engineering. 🍏🔌🎧 

Main Quest: I'm am currently working on simplifying the complexities of employee timekeeping. ⏰ I am aiming to create a company, offering an affordable product that enables customers to fulfill their obligations in a simple, self-managed way. 🎯

I'm all about design, development and making things happen. Excited to see where this journey takes me next!


My Workspace
======
1. make a picture of your workspace and circle / highlight 3 points that stimulate tinkering. Also, list three things that might improve tinkerability. (check if there is privacy-sensitive information, then don't show it or make a drawing or use an alternative picture)

My current setup has to be rather simplistic & digital, since my tiny student room can become crowded fast. Furthermore, I left a lot from my previous workspace in Germany to stay more flexible. This will make moving to Stockholm a breeze. Luckily the UT got me covered, but more about that later. Let me tell you inspires me on my personal Workspace nonetheless. 

#### My Mirror
When I first moved into my new student home, I was quite skeptical about why it had so many mirrors. Over time I did not only grew to like them, I noticed a real effect. Looking at yourself makes you feel responsible and accountable how you spend your time. It makes me productive and also makes me reflect... on the things I create. Another benefit is, that it scatters more light through my room, which makes it brighter. Who isn't more productive with a fair dose of sunlight? 

#### PocketOperator KO-33
My PocketOperator KO-33. What a wonderful piece of hardware. With this creation of my role model company Teenage Engineering, people create unique sample based music and for it's small form factor it is quite powerful. To me it looks bare bones, well thought out and industrial. It is a reminder to me, that good things are often simple. I strive with my creations to archive the simple elegance this device has. 

#### A Window
Yes, my window. Not only does it provide me with the sunlight that powers my day and thus my creations, it also allows me a nice view on the campus. It is a steady reminder, that whenever I reach a limit with my digital setup or need to get my hands dirty in order to get tangible results, I am only a 10 minute walk away from the Design Lab. Also other facilities like smart XP are in short reach, which empowers me to experiment and venture into new skills and projects. My window serves as a symbol for the possibilities I've been given and prompts me to get up and do things.
